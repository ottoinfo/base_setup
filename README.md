This is the stating point for a app from scratch or rebuild idea.

IDEA
-----

Docker Build File

FrontEnd Folder

BackEnd Folder

REASON
------

All though this project is not going to be broken up into multiple REPO's and it should. Everybody works off the same enviorment and no issues with wrong VERSIONs of NODE/etc.

APP
---

Starting point: Gonna build a simple gallery and image app. NGINX with NODE/Express for server and API portion. Postgres Database using Sequelize and Epilogue for data storage. Frontend portion will be React and Redux. I will most likely be using Webpack and setup the project to be isomorphic( render everything on SERVER ) for SEO and Speed.
